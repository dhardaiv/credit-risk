# Credit Risk Assessment

## Overview

This project involves assessing credit risk using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict loan default based on various borrower attributes and loan details. The notebook demonstrates data cleaning, preprocessing, and model training using the XGBoost classifier.

## Project Structure

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Scaling numerical features for better model performance.
- **Model Training**: Training an XGBoost classifier and evaluating its performance.
- **Evaluation**: Measuring the performance of the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `xgboost`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
